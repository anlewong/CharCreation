# CharCreation
building a better character creator
The goal of this project is to build a better character creator that includes all information off of wikidot 5e and an intuitive creator with links to optimization and role playing suggestions.

stat roller: the basic stat roller provides either a standard stat spread or randomized roll stats with options to show indiivdual rolls or end scores.

char search: uses webscraping to pull info from wiki-dot 5e and use it in order to have descriptions and greator ability to create characters for free compared to the DND Beyond or Roll 20

Auto leveler uses char search to have more sub-classes and more customizability
